##Introduction

Where most GPS maps will find you the easiest and the fastest way to go from point A to point B, peaceful map will provide with some ways to do the same but only taking small streets/roads, making you avoid the noisy and overwhelming big roads.
Taking small streets/roads is also an incredible way to travel not far from your accomodation, discover hidden things you would never have noticed if you had taken that so convenient but noisy main street.
